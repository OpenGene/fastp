# features
0. comprehensive quality profiling for both before and after filtering data (quality curves, base contents, KMER, Q20/Q30, GC Ratio, duplication, adapter contents...)
1. filter out bad reads (too low quality, too short, or too many N...)
2. cut low quality bases for per read in its 5' and 3' by evaluating the mean quality from a sliding window (like Trimmomatic but faster).
3. trim all reads in front and tail
4. cut adapters. Adapter sequences can be automatically detected, which means you don't have to input the adapter sequences to trim them.
5. correct mismatched base pairs in overlapped regions of paired end reads, if one base is with high quality while the other is with ultra low quality
6. trim polyG in 3' ends, which is commonly seen in NovaSeq/NextSeq data. Trim polyX in 3' ends to remove unwanted polyX tailing (i.e. polyA tailing for mRNA-Seq data)
7. preprocess unique molecular identifier (UMI) enabled data, shift UMI to sequence name.
8. report JSON format result for further interpreting. 
9. visualize quality control and filtering results on a single HTML page (like FASTQC but faster and more informative).
10. split the output to multiple files (0001.R1.gz, 0002.R1.gz...) to support parallel processing. Two modes can be used, limiting the total split file number, or limitting the lines of each split file.
11. support long reads (data from PacBio / Nanopore devices).
12. support reading from STDIN and writing to STDOUT
13. support interleaved input
14. ...

This tool is being intensively developed, and new features can be implemented soon if they are considered useful. If you have any additional requirement for `fastp`, please file an issue:https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp/issues/new

# simple usage
* for single end data (not compressed)
```
fastp -i in.fq -o out.fq
```
* for paired end data (gzip compressed)
```
fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz
```
By default, the HTML report is saved to `fastp.html` (can be specified with `-h` option), and the JSON report is saved to `fastp.json` (can be specified with `-j` option).

# examples of report
`fastp` creates reports in both HTML and JSON format.
* HTML report: http://opengene.org/fastp/fastp.html
* JSON report: http://opengene.org/fastp/fastp.json

```

`fastp` only relies on `zlib`, which is already available on most Linux-like systems. If you get an error like `undefined reference to gzbuffer` when compiling `fastp`, you may have to update the `zlib` (http://zlib.net)

# input and output
`fastp` supports both single-end (SE) and paired-end (PE) input/output.
* for SE data, you only have to specify read1 input by `-i` or `--in1`, and specify read1 output by `-o` or `--out1`.
* for PE data, you should also specify read2 input by `-I` or `--in2`, and specify read2 output by `-O` or `--out2`.
* if you don't specify the output file names, no output files will be written, but the QC will still be done for both data before and after filtering.
* the output will be gzip-compressed if its file name ends with `.gz`
## output to STDOUT
`fastp` supports streaming the passing-filter reads to STDOUT, so that it can be passed to other compressors like `bzip2`, or be passed to aligners like `bwa` and `bowtie2`. 
* specify `--stdout` to enable this mode to stream output to STDOUT
* for PE data, the output will be interleaved FASTQ, which means the output will contain records like `record1-R1 -> record1-R2 -> record2-R1 -> record2-R2 -> record3-R1 -> record3-R2 ... ` 
## input from STDIN
* specify `--stdin` if you want to read the STDIN for processing.
* if the STDIN is an interleaved paired-end stream, specify `--interleaved_in` to indicate that.
## store the unpaired reads for PE data
* you can specify `--unpaired1` to store the reads that read1 passes filters but its paired read2 doesn't, as well as `--unpaired2` for unpaired read2.
* `--unpaired1` and `--unpaired2` can be the same, so the unpaired read1/read2 will be written to the same single file.
## store the reads that fail the filters
* give `--failed_out` to specify the file name to store the failed reads.
* if one read failed and is written to `--failed_out`, its `failure reason` will be appended to its read name. For example, `failed_quality_filter`, `failed_too_short` etc.
* for PE data, if unpaired reads are not stored (by giving --unpaired1 or --unpaired2), the failed pair of reads will be put together. If one read passes the filters but its pair doesn't, the `failure reason` will be `paired_read_is_failing`.
## process only part of the data
If you don't want to process all the data, you can specify `--reads_to_process` to limit the reads to be processed. This is useful if you want to have a fast preview of the data quality, or you want to create a subset of the filtered data.
## do not overwrite exiting files
You can enable the option `--dont_overwrite` to protect the existing files not to be overwritten by `fastp`. In this case, `fastp` will report an error and quit if it finds any of the output files (read1, read2, json report, html report) already exists before.

## merge PE reads
See [merge paired-end reads](#merge-paired-end-reads)

# filtering
Multiple filters have been implemented.
## quality filter
Quality filtering is enabled by default, but you can disable it by `-Q` or `disable_quality_filtering`. Currently it supports filtering by limiting the N base number (`-n, --n_base_limit`),  and the percentage of unqualified bases.  

To filter reads by its percentage of unqualified bases, two options should be provided:
* `-q, --qualified_quality_phred`       the quality value that a base is qualified. Default 15 means phred quality >=Q15 is qualified. 
* `-u, --unqualified_percent_limit`    how many percents of bases are allowed to be unqualified (0~100). Default 40 means 40%

You can also filter reads by its average quality score
* `-e, --average_qual`   if one read's average quality score <avg_qual, then this read/pair is discarded. Default 0 means no requirement (int [=0])

## length filter
Length filtering is enabled by default, but you can disable it by `-L` or `--disable_length_filtering`. The minimum length requirement is specified with `-l` or `--length_required`.

For some applications like small RNA sequencing, you may want to discard the long reads. You can specify `--length_limit` to discard the reads longer than `length_limit`. The default value 0 means no limitation.

## low complexity filter
Low complexity filter is disabled by default, and you can enable it by `-y` or `--low_complexity_filter`. The complexity is defined as the percentage of base that is different from its next base (base[i] != base[i+1]). For example:
```
# a 51-bp sequence, with 3 bases that is different from its next base
seq = 'AAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGCCCC'
complexity = 3/(51-1) = 6%
```
The threshold for low complexity filter can be specified by `-Y` or `--complexity_threshold`. It's range should be `0~100`, and its default value is 30, which means 30% complexity is required.

## Other filter
New filters are being implemented. If you have a new idea or new request, please file an issue.

# adapters
Adapter trimming is enabled by default, but you can disable it by `-A` or `--disable_adapter_trimming`. Adapter sequences can be automatically detected for both PE/SE data.
* For SE data, the adapters are evaluated by analyzing the tails of first ~1M reads. This evaluation may be inacurrate, and you can specify the adapter sequence by `-a` or `--adapter_sequence` option. If adapter sequence is specified, the auto detection for SE data will be disabled.
* For PE data, the adapters can be detected by per-read overlap analysis, which seeks for the overlap of each pair of reads. This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.
* For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.
* For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.
* The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters. If your data is from the TruSeq library, you can add `--adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2=AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT` to your command lines, or enable auto detection for PE data by specifing `detect_adapter_for_pe`.
* `fastp` contains some built-in known adapter sequences for better auto-detection. If you want to make some adapters to be a part of the built-in adapters, please file an issue.

You can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file. Here is a sample of such adapter FASTA file:
```
>Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 1
AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA
>Illumina TruSeq Adapter Read 2
AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT
>polyA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
```

The adapter sequence in this file should be at least 6bp long, otherwise it will be skipped. And you can give whatever you want to trim, rather than regular sequencing adapters (i.e. polyA).

`fastp` first trims the auto-detected adapter or the adapter sequences given by `--adapter_sequence | --adapter_sequence_r2`, then trims the adapters given by `--adapter_fasta` one by one. 

The sequence distribution of trimmed adapters can be found at the HTML/JSON reports.

# per read cutting by quality score
`fastp` supports per read sliding window cutting by evaluating the mean quality scores in the sliding window. From `v0.19.6`, `fastp` supports 3 different operations, and you enable one or all of them:
* `-5, --cut_front`             move a sliding window from front (5') to tail, drop the bases in the window if its mean quality is below cut_mean_quality, stop otherwise. Default is disabled. The leading N bases are also trimmed. Use `cut_front_window_size` to set the widnow size, and `cut_front_mean_quality` to set the mean quality threshold. If the window size is 1, this is similar as the Trimmomatic `LEADING` method.
* `-3, --cut_tail`              move a sliding window from tail (3') to front, drop the bases in the window if its mean quality is below cut_mean_quality, stop otherwise. Default is disabled. The trailing N bases are also trimmed. Use `cut_tail_window_size` to set the widnow size, and `cut_tail_mean_quality` to set the mean quality threshold. If the window size is 1, this is similar as the Trimmomatic `TRAILING` method.
* `-r, --cut_right`             move a sliding window from front to tail, if meet one window with mean quality < threshold, drop the bases in the window and the right part, and then stop. Use `cut_right_window_size` to set the widnow size, and `cut_right_mean_quality` to set the mean quality threshold.  This is similar as the Trimmomatic `SLIDINGWINDOW` method.


***WARNING: all these three operations will interfere deduplication for SE data, and `--cut_front` or `--cut_right` may also interfere deduplication for PE data. The deduplication algorithms rely on the exact matchment of coordination regions of the grouped reads/pairs.***

If `--cut_right` is enabled, then there is no need to enable `--cut_tail`, since the former is more aggressive. If `--cut_right` is enabled together with `--cut_front`, `--cut_front` will be performed first before `--cut_right` to avoid dropping whole reads due to the low quality starting bases.

Please be noted that `--cut_front` will interfere deduplication for both PE/SE data, and `--cut_tail` will interfere deduplication for SE data, since the deduplication algorithms rely on the exact matchment of coordination regions of the grouped reads/pairs.

If you don't set window size and mean quality threshold for these function respectively, `fastp` will use the values from `-W, --cut_window_size` and `-M, --cut_mean_quality `

# base correction for PE data
`fastp` perform `overlap analysis` for PE data, which try to find an overlap of each pair of reads. If an proper overlap is found, it can correct mismatched base pairs in overlapped regions of paired end reads, if one base is with high quality while the other is with ultra low quality. If a base is corrected, the quality of its paired base will be assigned to it so that they will share the same quality.   

This function is not enabled by default, specify `-c` or `--correction` to enable it. This function is based on overlapping detection, which has adjustable parameters `overlap_len_require (default 30)`, `overlap_diff_limit (default 5)` and `overlap_diff_limit_percent (default 20%)`. Please note that the reads should meet these three conditions simultaneously.

# global trimming
`fastp` supports global trimming, which means trim all reads in the front or the tail. This function is useful since sometimes you want to drop some cycles of a sequencing run.

For example, the last cycle of Illumina sequencing is uaually with low quality, and it can be dropped with `-t 1` or `--trim_tail1=1` option.

* For read1 or SE data, the front/tail trimming settings are given with `-f, --trim_front1` and `-t, --trim_tail1`.
* For read2 of PE data, the front/tail trimming settings are given with `-F, --trim_front2` and `-T, --trim_tail2`. But if these options are not specified, they will be as same as read1 options, which means `trim_front2 = trim_front1` and `trim_tail2 = trim_tail1`.
* If you want to trim the reads to maximum length, you can specify `-b, --max_len1` for read1, and `-B, --max_len2` for read2. If `--max_len1` is specified but `--max_len2` is not, `--max_len2` will be same as `--max_len1`. For example, if `--max_len1` is specified and read1 is longer than `--max_len1`, `fastp` will trim read1 at its tail to make it as long as `--max_len1`.

Please note that the trimming for `--max_len` limitation will be applied at the last step. Following are fastp's processing steps that may orderly affect the read lengthes:
```
1, UMI preprocessing (--umi)
2, global trimming at front (--trim_front)
3, global trimming at tail (--trim_tail)
4, quality pruning at 5' (--cut_front)
5, quality pruning by sliding window (--cut_right)
6, quality pruning at 3' (--cut_tail)
7, trim polyG (--trim_poly_g, enabled by default for NovaSeq/NextSeq data)
8, trim adapter by overlap analysis (enabled by default for PE data)
9, trim adapter by adapter sequence (--adapter_sequence, --adapter_sequence_r2. For PE data, this step is skipped if last step succeeded)
10, trim polyX (--trim_poly_x)
11, trim to max length (---max_len)
```

# polyG tail trimming
For Illumina NextSeq/NovaSeq data, `polyG` can happen in read tails since `G` means no signal in the Illumina two-color systems. `fastp` can detect the polyG in read tails and trim them. This feature is enabled for NextSeq/NovaSeq data by default, and you can specify `-g` or `--trim_poly_g` to enable it for any data, or specify `-G` or `--disable_trim_poly_g` to disable it. NextSeq/NovaSeq data is detected by the machine ID in the FASTQ records.   

A minimum length can be set with `<poly_g_min_len>` for `fastp` to detect polyG. This value is 10 by default.

# polyX tail trimming
This feature is similar as polyG tail trimming, but is disabled by default. Use `-x` or `--trim_poly_x` to enable it. A minimum length can be set with `<poly_x_min_len>` for `fastp` to detect polyX. This value is 10 by default.   

When `polyG tail trimming` and `polyX tail trimming` are both enabled, fastp will perform `polyG trimming` first, then perform `polyX trimming`. This setting is useful for trimming the tails having `polyX (i.e. polyA) ` before `polyG`. `polyG` is usually caused by sequencing artifacts, while `polyA` can be commonly found from the tails of mRNA-Seq reads.

# unique molecular identifier (UMI) processing
UMI is useful for duplication elimination and error correction based on generating consensus of reads originated from a same DNA fragment. It's usually used in deep sequencing applications like ctDNA sequencing. Commonly for Illumina platforms, UMIs can be integrated in two different places: `index` or head of `read`.  
To enable UMI processing, you have to enable `-U` or `--umi` option in the command line, and specify `--umi_loc`  to specify the UMI location, it can be one of:
* `index1` the first index is used as UMI. If the data is PE, this UMI will be used for both read1/read2.
* `index2` the second index is used as UMI. PE data only, this UMI will be used for both read1/read2.
* `read1` the head of read1 is used as UMI. If the data is PE, this UMI will be used for both read1/read2.
* `read2` the head of read2 is used as UMI. PE data only, this UMI will be used for both read1/read2.
* `per_index` `index1_index2` is used as UMI for both read1/read2.  
* `per_read` define `umi1` as the head of read1, and `umi2` as the head of read2. `umi1_umi2` is used as UMI for both read1/read2.  

If `--umi_loc` is specified with `read1`, `read2` or `per_read`, the length of UMI should specified with `--umi_len`. 

`fastp` will extract the UMIs, and append them to the first part of read names, so the UMIs will also be presented in SAM/BAM records. If the UMI is in the reads, then it will be shifted from read so that the read will become shorter. If the UMI is in the index, it will be kept.

A prefix can be specified with `--umi_prefix`. If prefix is specified, an underline will be used to connect it and UMI. For example, UMI=AATTCCGG, prefix=UMI, then the final string presented in the name will be `UMI_AATTCCGG`.

If the UMI location is read1/read2/per_read, fastp can skip some bases after UMI to trim the UMI separator and A/T tailing. Specify `--umi_skip` to enable the number of bases to skip. By default it is not enabled.

## UMI example
The original read:
```
@NS500713:64:HFKJJBGXY:1:11101:1675:1101 1:N:0:TATAGCCT+GACCCCCA

6AAAAAEEEEE/E/EA/E/AEA6EE//AEE66/AAE//EEE/E//E/AA/EEE/A/AEE/EEA//EEEEEEEE6EEAA
```
After it's processed with command: `fastp -i R1.fq -o out.R1.fq -U --umi_loc=read1 --umi_len=8`:  
```

```

# output splitting
For parallel processing of FASTQ files (i.e. alignment in parallel), `fastp` supports splitting the output into multiple files. The splitting can work with two different modes: `by limiting file number` or `by limiting lines of each file`. These two modes cannot be enabled together.   

The file names of these split files will have a sequential number prefix, adding to the original file name specified by `--out1` or `--out2`, and the width of the prefix is controlled by the `-d` or `--split_prefix_digits` option. For example, `--split_prefix_digits=4`, `--out1=out.fq`, `--split=3`, then the output files will be `0001.out.fq`,`0002.out.fq`,`0003.out.fq`

## splitting by limiting file number
Use `-s` or `--split` to specify how many files you want to have. `fastp` evaluates the read number of a FASTQ by reading its first ~1M reads. This evaluation is not accurate so the file sizes of the last several files can be a little differnt (a bit bigger or smaller). For best performance, it is suggested to specify the file number to be a multiple of the thread number.

## splitting by limiting the lines of each file
Use `-S` or `--split_by_lines` to limit the lines of each file. The last files may have smaller sizes since usually the input file cannot be perfectly divided. The actual file lines may be a little greater than the value specified by `--split_by_lines` since `fastp` reads and writes data by blocks (a block = 1000 reads).

# overrepresented sequence analysis
Overrepresented sequence analysis is disabled by default, you can specify `-p` or `--overrepresentation_analysis` to enable it. For consideration of speed and memory, `fastp` only counts sequences with length of 10bp, 20bp, 40bp, 100bp or (cycles - 2 ).  

By default, fastp uses 1/20 reads for sequence counting, and you can change this settings by specifying `-P` or `--overrepresentation_sampling` option. For example, if you set `-P 100`, only 1/100 reads will be used for counting, and if you set `-P 1`, all reads will be used but it will be extremely slow. The default value 20 is a balance of speed and accuracy.  

`fastp` not only gives the counts of overrepresented sequence, but also gives the information that how they distribute over cycles. A figure is provided for each detected overrepresented sequence, from which you can know where this sequence is mostly found.

# merge paired-end reads
For paired-end (PE) input, fastp supports stiching them by specifying the `-m/--merge` option. In this `merging` mode:   

* `--merged_out` shouuld be given to specify the file to store merged reads, otherwise you should enable `--stdout` to stream the merged reads to STDOUT. The merged reads are also filtered.
* `--out1` and `--out2` will be the reads that cannot be merged successfully, but both pass all the filters.
* `--unpaired1` will be the reads that cannot be merged, `read1` passes filters but `read2` doesn't.
* `--unpaired2` will be the reads that cannot be merged, `read2` passes filters but `read1` doesn't.
* `--include_unmerged` can be enabled to make reads of `--out1`, `--out2`, `--unpaired1` and `--unpaired2` redirected to `--merged_out`. So you will get a single output file. This option is disabled by default.

`--failed_out` can still be given to store the reads (either merged or unmerged) failed to passing filters.

In the output file, a tag like `merged_xxx_yyy`will be added to each read name to indicate that how many base pairs are from read1 and from read2, respectively. For example, `
@NB551106:9:H5Y5GBGX2:1:22306:18653:13119 1:N:0:GATCAG merged_150_15` 
means that 150bp are from read1, and 15bp are from read2. `fastp` prefers the bases in read1 since they usually have higher quality than read2.

Same as the [base correction feature](#base-correction-for-pe-data), this function is also based on overlapping detection, which has adjustable parameters `overlap_len_require (default 30)`, `overlap_diff_limit (default 5)` and `overlap_diff_limit_percent (default 20%)`. Please note that the reads should meet these three conditions simultaneously.
